            <h3>DEVELOPMENT</h3>
            <p>From the moment I began my programming journey, I became fascinated with the development side of computer science. Specifically, I was drawn to understanding how applications and web technologies function and how they can be leveraged to add value to people's lives. I am excited to continue my journey of learning and growth through applying my existing knowledge on projects and expand it furthermore.  </p>

            <h3>EXTRACURRICULARS</h3>
            <p>Ever since I was a child I had a deep passion of exploring and learning new things and to experiment with them.Sketching, dancing and music being some of them.And I believe this lifestyle of mine greatly reflects on my profesional and student life as I am quick at grasping and even quicker at forgetting(just kidding).Additionally,i like to brainstorm until my brain explodes. </p>
